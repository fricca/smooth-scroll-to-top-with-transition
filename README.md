# Smooth Scroll-to-top with CSS transitions

## Description

Source: [http://github.com/fricca/smooth-scroll-to-top-with-transition](http://github.com/fricca/smooth-scroll-to-top-with-transition)

When clicking on the "to top" link the browser smoothly scrolls to the top of the document by using CSS transitions. Older browsers just jump to the top (no, there's no animation fallback).

Test it yourself by scrolling down and clicking on the appearing "to top" link on the right bottom :) For small viewports (below 35em width) the link is always at the page bottom.

### How it's done

When the "to top" link is clicked, a top margin is applied to the html element that smoothly moves the top of the document to the desired position. When the transition finished the new window position is applied and the margin is removed. *Note: I tried it the other way round: first move to window position, then apply transitioned margin, but: slower machines and iOS show visible jump to the new position before starting the transition.*

Flaws: The scrollbar behaviour seems a bit ... odd.

## Usage

### A. With defaults

#### Basic Example ([Demo](http://demos.corina-rudel.de/sst/sstt/basic))

1. Add the base stylesheet to your document, p.e. put the following in the `head`:
```html
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="scrolltotop.css" />
```
... or simply copy its contents to your own stylesheet.

2. Add the `scrolltotop.min.js` to your document and initialize the script, p.e. put the following lines before the closing `</body>` tag:
```html
	<script src="scrolltotop.min.js"></script>
	<script>scrollToTop();</script>
```

With this setup the "link-to-top" will be created by the script and appended at the bottom of your document.

### B. With customized options

Options that can be passed to the `scrollToTop` function as an object (the following code shows the defaults):
```javascript
	{
		// Name of link(s) that trigger(s) scrolling
		// as selector: #id or .class
		linkName: '',
		// distance to scroll (in pixels)
		// while link is invisible
		// only used if there's only ONE toplink
		hiddenDistance: '100',
		// content of topLink if created by script
		topLinkContent: 'To Top'
	}
```

#### Customized Example 1 ([Demo](http://demos.corina-rudel.de/sst/sstt/custom-1))

Use existing custom link for smooth scrolling, p.e. a link that has <code>id="topscroller"</code> and show the link as soon as the user has scrolled 50px from the top:
```html
	<script>
		scrollToTop({
			linkName: '#topscroller',
			hiddenDistance: '50'
		});
	</script>
```
Note that the option `topLinkContent` will have no effect; the original content of the custom link is always used.

#### Customized Example 2 ([Demo](http://demos.corina-rudel.de/sst/sstt/custom-2))

Use several custom links, p.e. links that have <code>class="toplink"</code>
```html
	<script>
		scrollToTop({
			linkName: '.toplink'
		});
	</script>
```
Note that neither the option `hiddenDistance` nor `topLinkContent` will have any effect and the default stylesheet `scrolltotop.css` will only affect the smooth scrolling of the page, not any of the links.

#### Customized Example 3 ([Demo](http://demos.corina-rudel.de/sst/sstt/custom-3))

Let the script create the link but change the default link text and make it always visible:
```html
	<script>
		scrollToTop({
			hiddenDistance: '0',
			topLinkContent: 'Scroll to top'
		});
	</script>
```

## Q &amp; A (<small>to myself</small>)

<dl>
	<dt>Why use margin-top for transition, not transform (that would have better performance)?</dt>
	<dd>
		Because fixed elements on the page will move along with the transformed root element, despite being fixed. I couldn't come up with a reliable solution to kind of "revert" the root transformation on the fixed element(s).
	</dd>
	<dt>Can this be used for smooth scrolling anywhere, p.e. on one page sites?</dt>
	<dd>
		Yes, example soon to come.
	</dd>
